You can send test email in several ways:
First of all, you should set application.properties properly.
1. Just build the project and the test email for order confirmation will be sent on Spring Boot Start.
2. You can use the web form and test all the cases of sending email in your browser.
Just start the application then type http://localhost:8080 and follow the web flow.
You can send simple email, email with template, email with attachment from the web.
